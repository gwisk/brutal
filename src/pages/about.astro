                What is FILMSLOP? Who are we?
              </p>
              <p class='md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl'>
                We're a new film review site, a passion project by Ali El-Sadany and George Iskander.
                We like to think we're not pretentious about it â€” but we are crazy about it.
                <br><br>
                Cinema is for the people, not the ivory tower. So why is film critique so scholastic and pretentious? Cinema was made for the theater but is experienced at home, on bootlegs, camrips, and decade-old 240p YouTube uploads. Cinema can be slop.
                <br><br>
                Film touches every part of human life: literature, music, hell, even what we eat. Here at FilmSlop, we welcome, more than anything, <i>your </i> story about the cinema. We welcome creative, critical (and critical-creative!) prose and poetry pieces about film.

            We accept pitches. We're not dogmatic, all we want is something personal (whatever that means to you). Read our published pieces to get a sense of what we're about. Then, pitch us, and we'll work with you.
