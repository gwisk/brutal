                We're a new film review site, a passion project by Ali El-Sadany and George Iskander. Movies are for the people, not the ivory tower. So why is film critique so scholastic and pretentious? Cinema was made for the theater but is experienced at home, on bootlegs, camrips, and decade-old 240p YouTube uploads. Cinema can be <i>slop</i>. Film touches every part of human life: literature, music, hell, even what we eat. Here at FilmSlop, we welcome, more than anything, <i>your </i> story about the cinema. We welcome creative, critical (and critical-creative!) prose and poetry pieces about film.
